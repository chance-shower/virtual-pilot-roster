# virtual-pilot-roster
Tool to generate a simulated pilot's flight schedule with options to export to SimBrief and document flight progress.

Built as a progressive web app.

Roadmap:

- Progressive Web App MVP
    - Initially keeping everything self-contained and locally saved
    - Basic schedule generation based of input variables (ailine, aircraft etc)
    - Simple noting arrival and departure times
- Add external connection
    - Data storage
    - Logins
- Extended functionality
    - Real world ops
    - Dynamic changes (emergency/failure, gate changes due to being early/late etc)
